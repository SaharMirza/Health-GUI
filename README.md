# Health-GUI
Java Project - Object-Oriented Programming

This GUI based project is a reflection of our common health based applications. It's constructed on the techniques used in Object-Oriented Programming.
It enables the use to calculate their BMR, BMI, and TDEE based on their personal body information. 
On top of that, it supports height (in Feet Inches and Centimeter) and weight convertors (in KG) based upon the user's requirement. 
The user can also estimate the water content in their foods and keep a record of their water intake.
The user can also accurately calculate their sleep time. 
The results are partially stored in the .txt file and are also displayed on the gui. 

The main classes (.java) include:
1. BMR (Body Mass Ratio)
2. BodyMassIndex
3. HeightCM
4. HeightFI
